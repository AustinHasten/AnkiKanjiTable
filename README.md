Visualize your progress by seeing your kanji cards in a pretty table with their maturity indicated by their color.

To be added:
* The ability to select a start date and end date and create a gif showing the table over that span (mostly done).
* re: Time Travel To - account for local time zone and rollover setting (simple)

Notes: 
* You can click on a cell to open that kanji's details in Jisho.
* For the Sort option, a card's Index is currently just the card's ID (can be found on the Card Info screen)
* The "Time Travel To" option shows what the table would have looked like at a specific point in time. If you set it to Jan 1 2020, the table should look like what it would have on that date. It can be fun to look back on your progress.
* The PNG Quality slider is a bit esoteric right now but just raise it if the PNG is not sharp enough. It controls each table cell's resolution in the resulting PNG and ranges from 25px\*25px to 200px*200px.
